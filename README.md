# 🌸 Flower Classification Project

This project uses deep learning to classify images of flowers into different categories. It was developed in **Google Colab** and uploaded to **GitHub** for sharing and future updates.

## 🧠 Model Overview
The notebook builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify flower images from a dataset.
